# QueryMaker-Node-Webkit

***This app was written with Node.js *** Query Maker 2.2 This Version allows the user to configure PSP's, languages, Forex, Tokenization, ShortCC, Open Position Commission and Regulation. The user can also use Browser-Sync with 1 click from the app. Behind the scenes it will access to conf.properties file and check if the required brand_id exists in “brands.values”. In addition it creates a Bonus template for the user and allows the user to choose from common used applications/commands like restart the server, open a terminal to server, BackOffice, Mobile-Web, Open Browser. "Set default brand id" button allows the user to change the default id of the server. It also provides services like Insightly, Jira, Help Center and RunDeck from the menu bar. ***** Please let me know of any bugs/issues or feature requests.***** Special Thanks To Yaakov Wizman for his help! :)
